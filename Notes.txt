On submit, each answer box will return an object, which will contain: 
1. Question 2.Answer format 3. Answer 4.Index of the Answer 
This answer object will be added to an array in the top level component 
Now we have all the data in the form of this array of objects 
Next, we will display it in a answers page, which will be laid out exactly like the interview page.

We will also be sending the array of objects to the backend
